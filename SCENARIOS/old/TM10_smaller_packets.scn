#  to achieve this, the total RRC_CONNECTED time per UE needs to be 139.01 [ sec ] ( 1759.91 [ UE ] * 1 [ sec ] / 12.66 (attach rate) [ UE ] ) :
#  - 10 [ sec ] takes the UE to go idle before detaching
#
#  - Sum of SR: 126.6/2 s; 63.3 = 12.66 attach/s * iterations => iterations = 5
#  - there are 5 iterations of Service Request component, so each iteration needs to have a UE for 27.8 [ sec ] in RRC_CONNECTED ( 139.01 [ sec ] / 5 =~ 27.8)
#  - Inactivity timer = 10s, so 27.8-10[inactivity] = 17.8
#
#  UEs RRC_CONN = 5 [iterations]*(10+17.8)[sec]*12.66 (attach_rate)=1759.74
#  UEs Idle = 12+5*(12-10)[go to idle]*12.66(attach_rate)=161.92
